'''
This py.typed file makes this package (test_project_python)
a PEP 561 compliant stub package.

Make sure to add a `package_data` argument consisting of
a `dict` with the key(s) corresponding to the package name(s)
and the value(s) corresponding to the file(s) in that package
that contain the type hint information to the `setup`
function (e.g. in `distutils.core.setup` or `setuptools.setup`).
If the type hint information is contained in inline type annotations,
a `py.typed` file should suffice.

```
package_data={"package_name": ["py.typed"]},
# OR if the package has stub files (ending in .pyi)
package_data={"package_name": ["py.typed", "module1.pyi", "module2.pyi"]},
```
